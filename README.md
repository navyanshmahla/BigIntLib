<p id="description">BigIntLib is a C++ library designed to handle large numbers with an arbitrary number of digits. While still in early development stages it provides basic support for addition operations. With ambitions to expand its functionality in the near future BigIntLib aims to offer comprehensive support for various arithmetic operations making it an essential tool for precise large numerical computations.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Large digit number arithmetic
*   Fast Computation
*   Many more to come ;)

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Clone the repository in your project folder</p>

```
git clone https://github.com/navyanshmahla/BigIntLib.git
```

<p>2. Add the include path to bigInt.hpp header</p>

```
#include "path/to/bigInt.hpp"
```

<p>3. An example to learn more about the syntax is given in the repo with the name example.cpp Make sure to check that out</p>

<h2>üç∞ Contribution Guidelines:</h2>

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BigIntLib! This repository is open to anyone who wants to contribute and make a meaningful impact on the development of this library. 

## Why contribute? 
- BigIntLib has the potential to become a valuable resource for high-speed numerical computations given a robust set of arithmetic operations. 
- Your contributions can help shape BigIntLib into a comprehensive library that serves the needs of developers working with large numbers. 

## How to Contribute: 
1. Fork the BigIntLib repository to your GitHub account. 
2. Create a new branch in your forked repository for your contributions. 
3. Make your desired changes and improvements to the library. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding conventions and style guidelines. 
4. Write clear and concise commit messages to describe your changes. 
5. Submit a pull request from your branch to the main BigIntLib repository. 
6. Your pull request will be reviewed and feedback or suggestions may be provided for further refinement. 

Once your contributions are approved they will be merged into the main repository. 

### Please Note: 
BigIntLib is currently in its early stages of development and only supports addition operations. Your contributions can greatly enhance its functionality and usefulness. I, the owner of this repository \[Navyansh Mahla\], an immature programmer still studying, is actively involved in other commitments and may not be able to actively contribute to BigIntLib. Thus the open-source community is crucial in driving its progress and making it a valuable tool for developers. I appreciate your understanding and valuable contributions to BigIntLib. Together we can build a powerful library for efficient and high-speed numerical computations.
